A hitchhiker's guide to Intelligent Supply Chain

Supply Chain application development made easier for developers


# Introduction:

This document provides a glossary, links and guides to topics about Intelligent Supply Chain.  It is a guide for developers, created by developers who are working with IBM's Open Intelligent Supply Chain.

Intelligent Supply Chains are changing the game when it comes to traditional warehouses, retailers, and consumers in general.  These type of supply chains connect people with processes, and things to enable visibilty, communication, planning, analysis, and execution. IBM's Sterling Supply Chain helps developers get end-to-end visibilty into the data and provides access to services that enables them to build intelligent business networks. Couple that with Artificial Intelligence which is helping to close the gap between what is fact and fiction in supply chain systems.

Developers in the supply chain industry need to build unique solutions that are constantly dealing with:

* Order fulfillment/Demand Planning: predicting customer demand while avoiding supply shortages
* Returns Management: addressing product returns
* Supplier Relationship: customer-service management issues
* Product development & commercialization
* Warehouse management

Developers need the right tools and technologies to help customize and configure solutions that reaches outside of the supply chain to solve issues connected with other parts of the business.  An intelligent supply chain system provides just that.  Supply chain management does not only refer to the movement of physical products through a supply chain but also the data associated with said products, including invoices, schedules and delivery information.  Developers needs software that provides visibility and clarity across the length of the supply chain.

The following sections are organized in alphabetical order. Although Douglas Adam's <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> series started with initial doubts, followed by cautious enthusiasm and ended with greater alarm, we promise your experience with this guide will not be remotely similar - please sit back and enjoy the ride

# Learn Key Terminology:

* Customer requirement processing - The Customer Requirement Processing process component provides the controlling of customer requirements in the supply chain. This involves checking product availability, receiving, preparing, and passing customer requirements on to supply planning and logistics, and providing feedback on fulfillment.

* eSCM - electronic supply chain - Electronic supply (e-supply) chain management is the evolving process of managing different supply streams digitally.  To properly run a business, you must make sure that you have the correct stock, the ability to replenish inventory when you need to and knowledge of how much you need to up charge on your inventory to turn a profit.  eSCM takes the concept of electronic business (e-business) and marries that with supply chain management (SCM).

* eBA - embedded business network - is a framework that is built upon an open and hybrid multi-cloud. It enables domain-specific process automation.  Developers describe the business domain to a machine unlike traditional dialogs that are based on rule-based reasoning or predictive technology.

* Purchase Order processing - The purchase order process is the journey of a purchase order (PO) from creation through purchase order approval, dispatch, delivery, invoicing, and closure. It also includes budget checks, contract management, quality checks, and more. It is advantagous to make use of a cloud-based solution for this processing.

* Inventory Management - Inventory management is the supervision of non-capitalized assets (inventory) and stock items. A component of supply chain management, inventory management supervises the flow of goods from manufacturers to warehouses and from these facilities to point of sale.

* Order Management - Order management involves the seamless integration of orders from multiple channels with inventory databases, data collection, order processing including credit card verification, fulfillment systems and returns across the entire fulfillment network.

* Multi-channel Order Aggregation - This is a process that collects orders from more than one source and aggregates them into a single location, this could be into your own system or that of a 3rd party.

* Warehouse Management - A warehouse management system is a software application designed to support and optimize warehouse functionality and distribution center management.

* Return Management - Returns management is the supply chain management process by which activities associated with returns, reverse logistics, gatekeeping, and avoidance are managed within the firm and across key members of the supply chain.

* Intelligent, self-correcting supply chains use artificial intelligence so you can make better decisions and take more informed actions faster.

* Docker - Ccontainer-based (meaning: everything needed to run an application is packaged) architecture that modernizes and increases solution delivery flexibility.

* OMS - Order Management System - An order management system (OMS) is an electronic system developed to execute securities orders in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Brokers and dealers use order management systems when filling orders for various types of securities and can track the progress of each order throughout the system

* Cognitive Analytic Engine - IBM Sterling Fulfillment Optimizer with Watson is a cognitive analytic engine that enhances existing order management systems. It provides a “big data brain” to order management and inventory visibility systems that are already in place with retailers who have eCommerce fulfillment capability.

# Trends

* IoT - Supply chains will understand the state of things and take action

* Blockchain - Multi-enterprise network hubs will be enabled with blockchain giving power to companies of all sizes

* Intelligent order management - Supply chains will orchestrate the perfect order and master inventory visibility.

* Quantum - Quantum computing can crunch through numerous variables and factors, from more sources, faster and with greater accuracy.


# Summary
Supply chain management and shipping logistics is big business. The evolution of blockchain technology – which allows greater transparency, security and trust in supply chain operations – mean that specialists and app developers are poised to profit greatly from the emerging demand for smarter supply chain management software.
